    "1. **提示链接**：将任务分解为连续的子任务，其中每个步骤都建立在先前结果的基础上\n",
    "2. **并行化**：在多个 LLM 之间分配独立的子任务以进行并发处理\n",
    "3. **路由**：根据输入特征动态选择专门的LLM路径\n",

      "    *   **Reduced Brand Loyalty:** Customers are more likely to \"shop around\" or switch to generic/cheaper alternatives to save costs.\n",
      "    *   **Longer Sales Cycles:** High-ticket items will face increased scrutiny, leading to delayed purchasing decisions.\n",

      "*   **Loyalty Incentives:** Implement rewards programs that focus on long-term value rather than just one-off discounts.\n",

      "*   **Action: Internal Mobility Program.** Create a \"Gig Marketplace\" within the company where employees can spend 10% of their time on projects in different departments to diversify their skill sets and increase internal versatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Priority 3: Providing Clear Direction (Alignment & Purpose)**\n",
      "*   **Action: The \"North Star\" Framework.** Leadership must distill the company’s response to market changes into three simple strategic pillars. Every department should map their daily tasks to one of these pillars to ensure efforts aren't wasted.\n",

      "*   **Filtering first:** If you only need data from a specific timeframe or status, apply those filters before exporting to keep your spreadsheet manageable.\n",

      "### Step-by-Step Guide\n",
      "To export your project data, follow these steps:\n",
      "1.  Navigate to the **Project Dashboard** of the project you wish to export.\n",
      "2.  Click on the **\"More Actions\"** (three dots) icon in the top right corner.\n",
      "3.  Select **\"Export Data\"** from the dropdown menu.\n",

      "5.  Toggle the **\"Include All Subtasks\"** switch if you need a complete granular breakdown.\n",
      "6.  Click **\"Generate Export.\"** You will receive a notification and an email link once your file is ready for download.\n",

      "*   **Public API:** If you find yourself exporting data frequently for external dashboards, our API can automate this data sync directly into your reporting tools.\n",
      "*   **Google Sheets Integration:** If you prefer cloud-based spreadsheets, our direct integration allows for a live-sync between your project and a Google Sheet.\n",
